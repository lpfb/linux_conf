=====================================
        Configuring Samba
=====================================

First of all, you should install samba cliente
>> sudo apt-get install samba

After that, you need to create a user on your linux desktop to acess the shared folder
Note: you also will be asked to create a password
>> sudo adduser --shell /bin/false <user-name> 

Now, you should add the created user to samba
Note: user the same passwaord used before
>> smbpasswd -a <user-name>

Now, it is necessary to create the directory that you want to share
>> mkdir <desired-dir>

Configuring samb.conf to share the desired files/folders
>> sudo vi /etc/samba/smb.conf

Creating the necessary configurations to enable external acess to the desired file/folder
>> You need to go to the end of the file and add the following:
>>  [<folder_name>] 
>>  path = /home/<user_name>/<folder_name>
>>  available = yes
>>  valid users = <created_user_name>
>>  read only = no
>>  browsable = yes
>>  public = yes
>>  writable = yes

To add write acess to the folder/file, it is necessary to do the following
>> chmod 777 <folder_name>

Finally, you sould restart samba cliente
>> sudo service smbd restart

=====================================
       Accessing shared folder
=====================================

Linux
> smb://<machine ip>/<folder_name>
> Use the same name and password of the user created <created_user_name>

Windows
> First, create a shortcut
> Next, add the path \\<machine ip>\<folder_name>
> Now you are able to access the fodler
